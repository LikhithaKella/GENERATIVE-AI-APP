# InsightGen - AI-based E-commerce Customer Behavior Analysis  
InsightGen is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) application designed to analyze and generate insights from an E-commerce Customer Behavior Dataset. It provides businesses with actionable insights into customer purchasing patterns, preferences, and behavior based on various demographic factors like age, gender, location, and purchase history.  
## Objective  
The goal of InsightGen is to empower businesses with valuable insights by analyzing customer data.By leveraging the **RAG Framework** and advanced AI techniques, the app identifies trends and provides recommendations to improve customer engagement and sales strategies.

## **Key Features**
- **Customer Behavior Analysis**: Analyzes customer data, including age, gender, location, and purchase history.
- **Insight Generation**: Generates actionable insights on purchasing patterns and customer preferences.
- **Data-Driven Decisions**: Helps businesses make informed decisions based on data-driven insights to improve customer experience and optimize marketing strategies.
- **AI Implementation**: Utilizes advanced machine learning models and the **RAG Framework** to process and generate insights from large datasets.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python

  - TensorFlow
  - Keras
- **Data Processing & Analysis**:
  - Pandas
  - NumPy
- **Data Visualization**:
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
- **Framework**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## **How It Works**
1. **Data Collection**: The application pulls a dataset that includes customer demographic information (age, gender, location) and their purchase history.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: The data is cleaned, and missing values or outliers are handled to ensure high-quality input.
3. **Model Training**: Machine learning models are trained to identify patterns in customer behavior, leveraging the RAG framework for better context understanding.
4. **Insight Generation**: The trained model generates insights based on the input data, offering suggestions for improving customer engagement and business strategies.
5. **Visualization**: Insights are presented through visualizations to help stakeholders understand the data in a more digestible format.

## **Future Improvements**
- **Real-Time Insights**: Integrating real-time data processing to generate live insights.
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Implementing personalized product recommendations for users based on their past behavior.
- **Deployment**: Deploying the model into a live environment using cloud-based services for easy access and usage by businesses.

## **Project Impact**
- By using **InsightGen**, businesses can gain a deeper understanding of their customers' needs and preferences, leading to **improved marketing strategies**, **optimized product offerings**, and **enhanced customer loyalty**.
- This project serves as a practical example of how AI can be applied to real-world data to drive business decisions and growth.
